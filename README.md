## About Me
My name is QIUWENDIAN, and I am a cybersecurity student with a strong interest in network security and cyber defense. I am currently building foundational skills in cybersecurity through hands-on labs and coursework, focusing on both practical tools and security concepts.

## Technical Skills
- Network scanning and enumeration (Nmap)
- Network traffic analysis (Wireshark)
- Python scripting for security analysis
- Linux system fundamentals
- Basic understanding of cyber threats and defenses

## Certifications and Training
- Cybersecurity coursework and laboratory exercises
- Hands-on practice with security tools and scripting
- Ongoing learning in cybersecurity fundamentals

## Project Experience

### Project 1: Network Scanning and Enumeration Using Nmap
- Tools: Nmap
- Description: Conducted network scanning and service enumeration to identify open ports and running services. This project helped me understand how attackers and defenders analyze network exposure and potential vulnerabilities.

### Project 2: Network Traffic Analysis Using Scapy
- Tools: Python, Scapy
- Description: Used Python and Scapy to analyze and manipulate network packets. This project improved my understanding of packet-level communication and traffic behavior.

### Project 3: ICS and IoT Exposure Analysis Using Shodan API
- Tools: Python, Shodan API
- Description: Developed a Python script to identify exposed ICS and IoT devices in Malaysia using the Shodan API. This project enhanced my understanding of OSINT techniques and real-world device exposure risks.

## Learning Journey
Throughout my cybersecurity studies, I have gained hands-on experience with various security tools and concepts. I found Linux system usage particularly challenging at the beginning, but I am actively improving through regular practice and experimentation. Each project has strengthened my technical confidence and problem-solving skills.

## Career Objective
My career goal is to work in a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a cybersecurity analyst, where I can monitor, analyze, and respond to security incidents while continuously developing my technical expertise.
